# Sales Prediction

Sales prediction helps business to manage manufacturing cost or advertising cost of the product.

In this project I want to use linear regression to predict future cost of the product using python. 
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle which contains information about product sales details. The columns of the dataset is as below:

1. Newspaper : Cost spent for advertising on new paper
2. TV: Charges for TV advertisement 
3. Radio: Expense for Radio advertisement
4. Sales: Unit sold

Sales of the product depend on the advertisement cost of the product.
